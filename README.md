Netanoids
---
Netanoids is an experimental science-fiction-inspired Andriod Application in which a netanoid (species 0) ambles around your device.

There's this idea of shared consciousness, that humans are all individual expressions of a single consciousness.  A netanoid is a single expression of the internet "consciousness".  

Species 0 will exhibit **moods** which will influence how it responds in given situations.  Moods are limited and programmed, but exhibited randomly.  

Species 0 will also contain a limited set of **questions** (e.g. *want to see a picture?*, *want to see something interesting?*).  Depending on Species 0's mood, it will retrieve a picture or a "something interesting" from different sources.

Species 0 also has **thoughts**, which will be retrieved at random intervals and come from varying sources based on mood.  

Finally, Species 0 will attempt to **respond** to user input by searching for keywords and retrieving information from a variety of sources.
